Once upon a time, there was a small wooden branch. 

The branch was lonely and wanted a friend but, having no legs, he could not get up and find one himself. After a while, he got used to his life on the ground in cold solitude. 

Then one fateful day, a huge beast with large teeth and hair all over its body appeared above him and, without warning, pounced upon him. 

The branch was terrified, his life flashing before his very eyes. He tensed up his tiny wooden body and waited for death to come. 

When nothing happened however, he assessed his surroundings, not knowing what to expect. 

He was moving - the beast carrying him in its teeth and proudly displaying him to the world. No one had ever been proud of him before. 

This made him proud of himself. 

And that is the story of how the branch made friends with a golden retriever at the park.

The end.
